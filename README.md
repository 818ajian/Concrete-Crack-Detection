# Concrete-Crack-Detection

This repository contains the code for crack detection in concrete surfaces.

The dataset.py file creates the training dataset class to be fed into the Convolutional Neural Network. The architecture of the CNN has been taken from the following paper - "Deep Learning-Based Crack Damage Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks" by Young-Jin Cha and Wooram Choi.
