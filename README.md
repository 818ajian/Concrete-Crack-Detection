# PyTorch implementation of concrete crack detection

## TODO:

 - [x] Make dataloader
 - [x] Construct model for 128 img size. Currently, it's for 256??
 - [x] Optimize cross entropy loss
 - [x] function to calculate precision and recall
 - [x] Save based on f1-score and train 
 - [x] Testing function - Break down image into 128 x 128
 - [x] Testing function - Pass through model and store outputs
 - [x] Superimpose outputs onto input image and save into 'out + datetime.time()' folder
 - [ ] Change model to original model
 - [x] Validation set and save for f1-score based on it
